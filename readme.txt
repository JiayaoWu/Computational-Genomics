Run the program: ./script.sh

Bash files:
1. script.sh: it calls train_model.sh and test_model.sh
2. train_model.sh
3. test_model.sh

Data files (they are in the 'data' folder):
1. GSE2034_series_matrix.txt
2. GSE14020-GPL96_series_matrix.txt
3. GSE14020-GPL570_series_matrix.txt

Expected output files:
1. All the output files will be in the 'results' folder
2. Under 'results' folder:
	Note: all of them will be automatically generated by our bash files
	a. conventional/ and distinct/ subfolders are the partitioned training
	   and testing files
		i. each of them will have test_x.txt, test_y.txt, train_x.txt and train_y.txt 
	b. params/ subfolder are all the trained models (used pickle to print them)
		i. under params/ folder, there are 6 subfolders:
			conventional/, distinct/, feature_conventional/, feature_distinct,
			pca_conventional/ and pca_distinct/
			a) each of them will have the following 7 files:
				gaussian.txt, linear.txt, log.txt, pol3.txt, pol4.txt, pol6.txt and relu.txt
	c. There are a few other txt files under the result folder, and they
	   will be automatically generated by our code
	   	i. all_model_params.txt: all trained models' get_param() output
	   	ii. genes.txt and selectedGenes.txt: used for selecting the top 20 genes
	   	iii. testXFinal.txt and testYFinal.txt: preprocessed from the secondary data
	   	iv. data.txt: the preprocessed from the primary data

Guidelines to verify:
Our program take max of 17 min to run, and it shouldn't require too much memory.
